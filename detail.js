    And telling it might make me break
    But I'll tell it anyway
    This chapter's about
    How you said there was nobody else
    Then you got up and went to her house
    You guys always left me out

    I still have the letter you wrote
    When you told me that I was the only girl
    You'd ever want in your life
    I guess my friends were right

    Each day goes by and each night, I cry
    Somebody saw you with her last night
    You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"
    You might love her now, but you loved me first
    Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
    Oh, you swore on every star
    How could you be so reckless with my heart?

    You check in and out
    Of my heart like a hotel
    And she must be perfect, oh well
    I hope you both go to hell

    I still have the letter you wrote
    When you told me that I was the only girl
    You'd ever want in your life
    I guess my friends were right

    Each day goes by and each night, I cry
    Somebody saw you with her last night
    You gave me your word, "Don't worry 'bout her"
    You might love her now, but you loved me first
    Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are (here we are)
    Oh, you swore on every star
    How could you be so reckless with my heart? (Heart)

    How could you be so reckless?

Just tell me if you changed your mind
If you changed your mind (Mind)

Don't mess with my head
Don't tell me you're falling
With your feet still on the ledge
I'm all out of breath

Don't kiss me, no, don't kiss me right now
On your lips, just leave it

Now we're sittin' here in your livin' room

We're sixty-five and you ask
When did I first know, I always knew

Crystal clear on a starlit night

I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life
See you standing in your dress

There'll never be another
I promise that I'll love you for the rest of my life

It's the way you love, I gotta give it back to you
I can't promise picket fences or sunny afternoons
But at night, when I close my eyes

      lyrics: `[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can still remember (What?) tryna shop a deal (Uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (Yeah), became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (What?) if I'd prevail (Huh?)
And all I did was (What?) put nine-inch nails (Where?)
In my eyelids now (What?)
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales (Yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem, 50 Cent]
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

You got me singing love songs
Oh, this the type of song you tip on four fours and pour up song
Yeah, that make you fall in love song
That "Hey, bighead, what you on?" Make you hit me up song
Double cupped, but bae, I'm leaning on you
You been playing games, I'm tryna make you my boo
I don't duck no action, you bust one and I bust two
Pills of satisfaction, I take the red, you pop the blue

[Chorus]
And if we paint a perfect picture, we can make it last forever
And you the only one I want to wear my orange sweater
I told you I am down for the worse or the better
But I keep sticking to you 'cause them four stupid letters
You got me singing love songs (Love songs, love songs)
You got me singing love songs (Love songs, love songs)

To think about you in that way
But, I would be lying
And I pretend I'm happy for you
When you find some dude to take home
But I won't deny that

In the shapes, in the clouds
I don't see nobody but you
In my rose-tinted dreams
Wrinkled silk on my sheets
I don't see nobody but you

Boy, you got me hooked onto somethin'
Who could say that they saw us comin'?
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me, do you feel the love?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

And I could say I never unzipped
Those blue Levi's inside my head
But that's far from the truth
Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
“We'll be friends forever”

Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice, you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you

[Verse 1: Mark, Jeno, Jisung]
야, 요즘 왜 그리 풀이 죽어 있어?
야, 어깨 좀 펴라 옆엔 내가 있어
인생이란 게 뜻대로 안 되지, uh?
참 맘이란 게 맘대로 안 되지, uh?
That's right
어른이 돼가나 봐, 사는 게 그런가 봐
사람들 다 앞서 나가는 듯한, 나 혼자 멈춘 듯한
That's a life
어쩔 수 없는 듯한 막연한 불안함
Tell me if you're feeling that
나도 그래 가끔씩

[Pre-Chorus: Renjun, Haechan]
고민 따윈 잠시 던져 놔
To the sound of the music
마음속의 소릴 들어봐
원하는 건, do it, 그냥 do it

[Chorus: Jisung, Jaemin]
Don't stop the music, 왜 멈춰 있어?
춤추듯 돌아가, life is a party so
딱히 뭘 안 해도, tick-tock, tick-tock
Life is still going on, 그저 흘러가
Hey, DJ play that song, 다음 노래
It's like a music box, 걱정은 그만해
오늘은 즐겨봐 잠시라도
Life is still going on, 암튼 흘러가

[Verse 2: Jeno, Mark, Jisung, Jaemin, *Jaemin & Haechan*]
자 다들 하잖아 괜한 짓 엄한짓두
누가 보면은 금방이라도 세상이 망한 줄
균형을 잡아가는 중 (Yeah), 헛발질 좀 한 것뿐 (Yeah)
원기옥을 모았다 쏴 (Yeah), tick-tick-tick, boom
태엽을 감아, 다시 해도 괜찮아
조금 비틀대다 혼자만의 리듬을 찾아
잠깐 흔들려도 돼, 멀리 돌아가도 돼
즐길 수 있으면 돼, 결국 행복하면 *돼*

[Pre-Chorus: Chenle, Chenle & Haechan, Renjun, Renjun & Haechan]
고민 따윈 잠시 던져 놔
To the sound of the music
마음속의 소릴 들어봐
원하는 건, do it, 그냥 do it


[Chorus: Mark, Chenle, Jeno, Renjun]
Don't stop the music, 왜 멈춰 있어?
춤추듯 돌아가, life is a party so
딱히 뭘 안 해도, tick-tock (Tick-tock, oh) tick-tock
Life is still going on, 그저 흘러가
(Oh) Hey, DJ play that song, 다음 노래
It's like a music box, 걱정은 그만해
오늘은 즐겨봐 (Yeah) 잠시라도
Life is still going on, 암튼 흘러가

[Bridge: Jaemin, Jisung, Renjun, Haechan, *Chenle*, **Jeno**]
요즘 왜 그리 풀이 죽어 있어? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
어깨 좀 펴라 옆엔 내가 있어 oh, yeah
So let's go (Let's go)
그 어떤 것도 막지 못해
*언젠가 지나갈 거야, 결국에 알게 될 거야
So what you waiting for?* (Waiting for?)
**One, two, three, four**

[Chorus: All, Haechan, Chenle, Renjun]
Don't stop the music, 왜 멈춰 있어? (Woo, ooh, woo)
춤추듯 돌아가, life is a party so
딱히 뭘 안 해도, tick-tock, tick-tock
Life is still going on (Yeah), 그저 흘러가
Hеy, DJ play that song (Yeah), 다음 노래
It's like a music box, 걱정은 그만해
오늘은 즐겨봐 (Oh), 잠시라도
